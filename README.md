# The advetures of the Own Boho

My project fo the national level of the IT Znaiko competition.

or

Go to https://scratch.mit.edu, import the project and to your thing.


## How it's made
I made Boho move when you click the arrow keys. So I made the diamonds and the flashes fall. I made lives that diminish when you touch lightning or pink flowers (for the second level). I made a diamond counter, so that if you touch it, you can collect a diamond or a clover (for the second level). I made a button with which you can play the level again.

I used blocks: If, Variables, Operators, Senses, Events, and more.
